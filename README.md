# Most Useful README Generator

## Description
Developers have to write good README's for every project they make. It gets annoying to format a README every time, so I created a generator that does all of the repetitive work for me. I thought that creating this generator would be a great way to practice my new Node.js skills while building something useful at the same time.  

Through this project, I learned important Node.js skills like writing and appending a file, creating command input prompts, and using template literates to implement variables and functions into written text. I also learned how to make writing functions more simply and efficiently. What makes my project stand out is its user-interface. The prompts are easy to navigate, and users can choose whether or not they want a table of contents. Lists and screenshots are displayed in an aesthetic way for the user without the user needing to re-format what they write.

## Usage
1. Download the index.js file
2. Install NPM with Inquirer
3. Open the terminal and type 'node index.js'
4. Respond to the given prompts
5. You're done!
